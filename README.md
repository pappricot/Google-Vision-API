Google Vision API

Categorizing images using Google Vision APi with python Project consist of three parts:
1.	Get image files from user's directory
2.	Send images to Google Vision API and get images' labels: description, score, facial detection (there are more labels in Google API) *if human faces detected: draw a square around it.
3.	Push images and desired labels to html.
For each part, create a class to encapsulate functions accordingly.
